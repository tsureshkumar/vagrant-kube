# vagrant-kube
simple Kubernetes sample Vagrant file two multi node 

The provisioning script does not check for any errors. 
As of now, this repo only serves as a bookmark of what needs to be run to make a
kubernetes cluster.  It assumes a lot of things, for example availability of
network ip address mentioned in the Vagrant file.

Neverthless, this one is the minimal Vagrant file to get a kuberntes cluster
going with kubeadm.
